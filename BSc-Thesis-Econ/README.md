Here my BSc thesis in Economics: "**Climateflation: il cambiamento climatico guida l'inflazione**" (= _Climateflation: Climate Change drives Inflation_").

In 2021, I decided to start writing my final paper in LaTeX.

In this repo, you can find all the files of the project: images, style sheet, references, and source files. Compile `0-main.text` with whatever Tex compiler you prefer, and you will obtain the full pdf.
